%FRANKOTCHELLAPPA Generates surface given gradients.
%   DEPTHS = FRANKOTCHELLAPPA(DFDX, DFDY) reconstructs a depth map from the
%   gradients DFDX and DFDY using an implementation of Frankot and
%   Chellappa's algorithm for constructing an integrable surface from
%   gradient information.
%
%   DEPTHS is the inferred depths.

% The following sets up matrices specifying frequencies in the x and y
% directions corresponding to the Fourier transforms of the gradient
% data.  They range from -0.5 cycles/pixel to + 0.5 cycles/pixel.

[wx, wy] = meshgrid(linspace(-pi/2, pi/2, ncols), linspace(pi/2, -pi/2, nrows));

% Quadrant shift to put zero frequency at the appropriate edge

wx = ifftshift(wx);
wy = ifftshift(wy);

% Fourier transforms of gradients

dfdxfft = fft2(dfdx);
dfdyfft = fft2(dfdy);

% Integrate in the frequency domain by phase shifting by pi/2 and weighting
% the Fourier coefficients by their frequencies in x and y and then
% dividing by the squared frequency.  To avoid division by 0 eps is added
% to the denominator.

% Equation 21:

depthsfft = (1i*wx.*dfdxfft + 1i*wy.*dfdyfft)./(wx.^2 + wy.^2 + eps);

% Reconstruction

depths = real(ifft2(depthsfft))/2;
